# AWS Overview and MFA Setup

### What is cloud?
    Back in the old days,organizations and other companies use to host and maintain hardware which includes computing,storage and networking equipment in their own data centre. It asks for a whole separate division to do its maintainance and management which was costly and very uneconomical.
    
   In order to resolve such issues, the concept of the cloud computing emerged. It is an on-demand services for the IT resources with concept of pay-as-you-go pricing. One dont have to manage or own the data centres, everything can be done in the virtualized environment and service over the internet.
   
 ### Overview of the benefits:
  - Pay as you go
